			<header>My Name Izz Hafeez</header>
			<summary><span id="default">I am a hyperproductive and multidisciplinary programmer with 2 years of <a href="#experience">experience</a> in Data Analytics. An advocate for lifelong learning, I spend my free time undertaking various <a href="projects.html">projects</a>, which you can find on this site. You can also find my various <a href="#skills">skills</a>, <a href="#awards">awards</a> and <a href="#certifications">certifications</a>. This site is very dynamic, so you may resize it as much as you'd like.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="geospatial-analytics">Geospatial Analytics was my main role during my time in National Service (NS), so I have quite a unique set of experiences in this area. Here are some of the experiences I have with Geographic Information System (GIS) data:
				<ol>
					<li>I've operated, maintained and built upon a machine learning model that optimises the placement of SCDF resources in Singapore.</li>
					<li>I've produced multiple scripts and reports that deal with GIS data.</li>
					<li>I've created my MALLS card game using various GIS techniques and ideas.</li>
					<li>I've designed a Telegram Bot that searches for nearby Halal food based on certain criteria.</li>
					<li>I've had experience with various Geospatial tools such as Geopandas, Tableau, QGis and Google's Distance Matrix API.</li>
				</ol></span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="python">I picked up Python in late 2016 and since then, I've used it every step of the way. Here are some of my experiences with Python:
				<ol>
					<li>I've completed the "Python for Everybody" and the "Deep Learning with Tensorflow" courses.</li>
					<li>I've served my Robotics Club as its Programming Head for a year, teaching Python to the other clubmates.</li>
					<li>I've used Pandas and a slew of other Python packages to wrangle and harmonise data during my time in NS.</li>
					<li>I've produced many packages to assist in producing analytics reports and output files.</li>
					<li>I've done a lot of developmental work to improve the functionalities of the optimisation model mentioned above.</li>
					<li>I've used Python in the National Informatics Olympiad and barely missed the Merit award.</li>
				</ol></span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-wrangling">Besides the optimisation model I operated, I was involved in many other reports and projects. In them, I transformed and mapped a great deal of data to more useful formats. This often involved cleaning dirty data and processing complex columns using programming tools. And from those numerous projects, I've gained a deep understanding and appreciation for data cleansing.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="critical-thinking">Critical Thinking involves the mental processing of information and can be categorised into 4 types. I often used it when answering queries regarding SCDF resource placement. Here are some of the ways I've practised critical thinking:
				<ul>
					<li>Convergent Thinking - Using the tools provided by the optimisation model, I was able to answer the queries raised by management officers.</li>
					<li>Divergent Thinking - Whenever a problem occurred with the model, I was quick to come up with workarounds. Examples include the monetisation of Google API, the prohibitions on discs, and the mismatch of Anaconda versions, all of which were combatted with the appropriate workarounds.</li>
					<li>Critical Thinking - I often had to provide my own conclusion and recommendation when presenting my simulation/optimisation results.</li>
					<li>Creative Thinking - I often ventured into the code of the model and managed to find new ways to improve its functionality.</li>
				</ul></span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="web-development">Besides attending a course on Fullstack Web Development, I've done a lot of programming in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I've also experimented on Flask, Django, Angular and React, following guides online to produce small projects. Professionally, I've coded a Sharepoint Portal which utilised and integrated native Sharepoint methods. And of course, my websites rely on a bit of JavaScript as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-harmonisation">Similar to data wrangling, I've done tangible data harmonisation and normalisation work. Particularly, I've transformed the common xlsx, xml, mp3 and json files, and also the less common geojson, shp and xls files. I also have a decent understanding of ETL scripts and processes.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="ui-ux">Before settling with this design, this website has gone through quite a number of revisions. All to help me understand what designs work and what don't. Other than that, I've also built a Sharepoint Portal, which truly tested my ability to condense large chunks of information into a succinct website. Finally, I've done substantial rework on an optimisation software, making the experience as streamlined as possible.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-analytics">This was my job title for my NS. It involved using various programs, data and computational tools to provide relevant insights in big data. All to improve efficiency at the workforce.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="web-scraping">I've relied on web scraping to retrieve data online. Among others, I've used it to build my language packages, my Halal Telegram Bot as well as my MALLS Card game. I always make it a habit to produce standardised datasets.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-visualisation">Besides my experience in Tableau and Power BI, I've worked with several other visualisation tools. Specifically, I have experience in using R's ggplot package, creating quite a bit of visualisations during my EDX course as well as my own mini-projects. I've also heavily used 's Geoplot, Matplotlib and Seaborn.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="independent-learning">An avid advocate for independent learning, I've taken it upon myself to learn as much as I can during whatever free time I have. I've dived deep into a wide range of topics, from my interests in Geography, Astronomy and Languages, to refining my Music and Math hobbies. Often times, during my NS stint, I've had to learn new skills to complete my tasks. Skills such as Ruby, Pandas and Unix.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="music-arrangement">Over a long period, I've refined my ability in arranging music, particularly piano arrangements. Since I started posting piano transcriptions on my Youtube in March 2019, the quality of my arrangements have seen steady improvements.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-science">Data Science is a broad term, as I have ventured quite deep into Machine Learning, NLP, RNN and Sentiment Analysis. I've also done courses in Data Science and Deep Learning.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="business-analytics">Building off from Data Analytics, I was often tasked to provide my own conclusion for the reports I gave, which meant making my own judgements on what decisions should be made to combat the issue at hand. Often times, the problems were complex and practical solutions were hard to come by.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="musescore">I've intensely used MuseScore when making my music arrangements and am quite familiar with the fine-tuning tools as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="mathematical-modeling">I've used my prior maths knowledge to develop intensive functions and equations to solve problems. Most of it was done during my NS life, so I can't share them here.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="cloud-computing">Besides undergoing training in AWS and Azure fundamentals, I've played around with the Google Cloud Platform, using them for my various Telegram Bots.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="g-suite">Many of my projects are based in Google Suite, particularly the Google Sheets. I use Google Sheets as my primary database, as I can both manually input and at the same time can easily extract out data into my Telegram Bots or Python codes. Other than that, I have experience in using the various APIs that Google Suite has to offer such as the Gmail and YouTube API.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="html">I've had HTML experience since I was 13, but only since 2019 did I practice it. At the beginner stages, I've followed tutorials online and even read a book on it. As for practicing, in NS, I've assisted the developer of the department website, providing my inputs and suggestions regarding the technical design. I've also dabbled with XHTML.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="css">CSS is constantly evolving so every iteration of my website uses a brand new set of CSS. As much as possible, my newer designs use as little JavaScript as possible, but instead have the dynamic portions be controlled solely by CSS. I've also dabbled with SCSS.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="microsoft-office">Experience in Microsoft Office is a given, but more specifically, I have developed on Excel, Power BI and Sharepoint, along with the M, DAX, VBA and SQL languages. A little experience in Azure as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="r">Besides completing the HarvardX Data Science course taught in R, I've done further data science projects in R, producing machine learning models and visualisations. Professionally, I've used a little R during my time in NS. Besides running and maintaining data cleansing scripts in R, I have translated a few R scripts into Python, in order to facilitate the paradigm shift from R to Python.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="jupyter">Jupyter is my primary IDE, as it also works as a teaching tool. It facilitates the Data Science process and can be used to develop R programs as well!</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="hyperproductivity">I tend to neglect my health in pursuit of learning and creating things. Often times, I forget to sleep and eat, just because there are things I'd like to complete. During my NS, most of this added time went into learning languages and creating music but as time went on, my attention went into my coding projects and courses.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="robotics">I've had experience with VEX Robotics and the RobotC language. I've also had some experience using Arduino and Raspberry PI.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="mandarin">I currently am at the HSK 5 level and although my speaking skills are not up to par, my written skills are quite decent. I receive all my local news via 早报 and am constantly on the lookout for new vocab.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="analytical-reasoning">At the start of my NS journey, I had a hard time trying to interpret data. However, as time passed, I became quite familiar with it, having an understanding of what the users need to know and how to best present my findings.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="git">I've used git quite a bit in the past and it was covered in a couple of the courses I took. However, due to github being blocked during NS, I had to resort to un-Git-like practices during the bulk of my programming journey.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="api">I've played around with a myriad of API, but I've focussed on Google's Distance Matrix API, Telegram's API, and LTA Data Mart's API. I understand the API usage and development process and know the ethical limitations of abusing them.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="mentoring">During my time in Robotics Club, I taught Python to the other clubmembers. The sessions didn't go too well, so I learned from my mistakes and managed to teach programming decently well to newcomers to the Transformations and Future Technology Department (TFTD). For the second half of my second year of NS, I served as a mentor to my juniors, helping them solve their programming-related problems.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="google-apps-script">Google Apps Script is the language that my Telegram Bots are written in. Google API calls are limited in space and frequency, so I often have to optimise the code wherever possible.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="sharepoint-development">I've developed and published a Sharepoint Site from start to finish. It is currently used organisation-wide.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="written-communication">In designing the Sharepoint Site, I had to condense large chunks of information into succinct phrases that anyone can understand. I've also had to do up minutes to important meetings, further refining my written communication skills.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="sql">Besides experimenting with the SQL Alchemy package in Python, I primarily used SQL when using Power BI on top of creating scripts in SSMS.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="sublime">Sublime is what I use to code in HTML and CSS, as well as my Python packages. I've gotten quite accustomed to the different shorthand expressions and enjoy using it.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="power-bi">I've had some Power BI training and have used it to produce a couple of visualisations.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="telegram-bots">I have many Telegram Bots thus far and I am quite familiar with the creation process from start to finish. I am able to create interactive Telegram Bots. Among them, I've produced Telegram Bots that help to search for words in the dictionary, search for Halal food, as well as idioms.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="machine-learning">I have experience in every step of the Machine Learning process and have attended a few courses in it as well. Out of the entire process, I've done the most in Data Preparation.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="tableau">I've attended the Tableau Day Out event in 2019 and used it a little bit during NS, where I've played a role in testing, developing and grading dashboards. Apart from that, I've experimented with Tableau when producing my Data Science projects.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="leadership">Apart from having some leadership roles during NS, I've served my Robotics Club as its Programming Head, so I managed to lead that as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="music-composition">I've had quite a long period of time to improve my composition skills. But as of now, I only know how to compose piano pieces.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="graphic-design">Besides creating informatics for a Sharepoint Site, I have some experience creating posters as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="jquery">The previous versions of this site heavily relied on JQuery functions, for the aesthetics. Since then, the aesthetics portion of JQuery has been taken over by my use of responsive CSS.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="documentation">I've done documentation to several of my professional and personal projects, to pass down to my successors.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-governance">I produced a Sharepoint Site about Data Governance. In order to do so, I internalised quite a decent amount of content. From Data Acquisition, to Data Fusion, to Data Management, to Data Exploitation, I've absorbed information about every step of the data life-cycle.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="photoshop">I've Photoshopped quite a number of pictures in the past, either to enhance certain aspects, or to crop out entire sections. I've posted quite a number of them online.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="javascript">Besides attending the Fullstack Web Development course, I've used JavaScript to create my websites. I've also used Google Apps Script (based in JavaScript) to produce my Telegram Bots. I know a bit of Angular and React as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="nlp">I've done up a couple of NLP projects using Tensorflow, although the models are not good enough.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="malay">Malay is my Mother Tongue and I use it at home. My written Malay is quite decent, but my speaking skills are not so good.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="business-intelligence">The Data Science reports that I produce are used for making business decisions. I also produced a few dashboards, which also helped in making business decisions.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="minute-taking">I've done up minutes for several important meetings among higher management staff.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="artificial-intelligence">I've gone for a course on AI and spent a bit of time supporting AI projects as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="agile-framework">I have experience in working under an Agile methodology, with daily standups serving as progress updates.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="dax">DAX is the language of Excel and Power BI, and I have used it on numerous occasions to manipulate data.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-modeling">I went for a couple of Data Modeling training sessions and have experience in using ER Studio, assisting developers in producing their data models.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="ssms">I've produced a few scripts using Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio. I've received some training for this as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="audio-analysis">I've experimented on Python codes that extracted the chords to any song. It used Librosa but the code didn't go that far as there was a lot of theory to understand before attempting it.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="video-editing">I've produced several videos for my YouTube and other accounts. I've edited the videos using iMovie and some Python packages.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="anaconda">Besides using Anaconda for my Python and R packages, I've dealt with some Anaconda versioning issues in the past.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="c-sharp">I have a bit of experience coding in C#. Originally, I was supposed to develop scripts in C#, so I took it upon myself to learn C# following a tutorial online. I did a couple of programming tasks as well. However, due to a change in plans, I didn't get to apply my knowledge.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="aws">Went for a course on AWS fundamentals and had some hands-on experience as well. I also experimented on using AWS to power my Telegram Bots, but quickly switched over to the more convenient Google Cloud Platform.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="er-studio">I've received training for ER Studio and have assisted developers in the development of Data Models.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="japanese">I've been self-studying for the JLPT N3 test, and am able to understand Japanese to a low-moderate extent.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="software-testing">I've tested a couple of softwares during NS and my time at MOM.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="vs-code">I have used VS Code quite a bit, when following the fullstack web development course. I also did up a couple of small scripts using VS Code</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="music-production">I have produced some simple tracks using FL Studio and Garage Band. And, if count it, I've done some mixing and tweaking using MuseScore.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="ruby">Ruby was a language used during my NS. I mostly did some maintenance work on it, tweaking certain parts of the code. But I also added some of my own clauses as well. I've played around quite a bit on this, considering that my personal laptop couldn't set it up properly.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="qgis">I've only used QGis a bit during NS, but I got interested in the software, so I tried it out on my own, using it to display my Geospatial Data.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="vba">I've created a couple of VBA scripts to replace Python code temporarily when the code didnt work.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="seo">I've implemented SEO practices when creating my site and artworks.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="azure">I've gone for Azure fundamentals training and have had hands-on experience.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="french">I've completed the French course on Duolingo and have communicated with native speakers over HelloTalk.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="cpp">I have experience in using C++ in 2017, when starting out in coding.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="php">I've attended the Fullstack Web Development course which taught PHP programming.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="web-analysis">I've gone through the analytics for my sites and channels to find out what content works and what doesn't.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="korean">I've joined a course in Korean and continued to learn it afterwards.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="java">I've just started my journey in Java and using the Eclipse IDE during my Java course.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="m">I've learnt the M language to better understand Power BI power query code.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="spanish">I've learnt Spanish on Duolingo and understand quite a bit of the grammar.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="flstudio">I've used FL Studio to produce some simple beat tracks.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="swift">I've tried out Swift on online compilers.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="robotc">I've used RobotC to program the VEX Robots during my time in the Robotics Club.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="data-architecture">I've attended training on Data Architecture.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="mom">Over my 6 months at the Ministry of Manpower, I've attended a great number of training sessions, either by developers (Power BI, SSMS, ER Studio) or from external vendors (AWS, Azure, Snowflake). As for my monthly tasks, I did work in DevSecOps, where I helped in the management of privileged accounts. Particularly, I streamlined the process using DAX functionalities. Apart from that, I was involved in the creation of some dashboards and data models. There was also my task to take down minutes of important meetings, summarising the key decision points. But by far my most important role was to design and publish a Data Governance Portal. The site was designed using HTML, CSS and Sharepoint functionalites and is currently used organisation-wide as a source of Data Governance guidelines and explanations.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="scdf">I served my National Service in the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI) branch of the Transformations and Future Technologies Department (TFTD) in the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). My main role involved the operation, maintenance and development of a Dynamic Resource Optimisation (DRO) model. The project aimed to optimise the placement of SCDF resources throughout Singapore. My main role consisted of transforming and manipulating data for training. However, during the COVID period, I was left to my own resources, so I did my best and made the code as streamlined as possible, reducing a six-step process into a two-step one. Other than the DRO project, I was roped in to many other projects as well, mostly exploring the datasets and coming up with preliminary conclusions.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="vrmc">I was appointed to become the Programming Head due to my prior experience in Python programming. In this position, I first had to rapidly learn the RobotC language within 3 weeks, in order to support the teams in competing in the annual VEX championships. I managed to even come up with slides for it and taught it briefly to the other clubmates. This was the first time I was teaching something, so it didn't go as planned. This continued when I taught Python to others. Nevertheless, it was a good learning experience as my teaching skills eventually improved. Other than that, I've contributed greatly to the Robotics Camp for the next intake of members, coming up with activities on the spot.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="malls">I've created a statistics-driven card game based around the shopping malls of Singapore. Data was extracted using Python, and compiled using R. I also did some dynamic ranking using Google Sheets. As for the design, I did it in HTML and CSS, making use of as much data as I can. The cards have been tested on numerous occasions and have seen quite a number of integral shifts. Hopefully in the future I can publish the game for real.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="python-packages">My coding projects exist mainly to support my other hobbies, such as Music Composition, Language Learning and my MALLS Card Game development. Although I've done quite a number of Data Science models and web applications, the main bulk of my work consists of web-scraping functions, which helps to extract and parse data. For my music ambitions, I have created code that outputs the chords to any song, standardising them into suitable formats. For my language-learning ambitions, I have created code that searches for sample sentences for any particular words. Finally, for my MALLS Card Game, I've developed many Geospatial functions that manipulate data from many sources and condense them into harmonised datasets.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="java-course">The course teaches me about development in Java, including the frameworks. There are several projects in there as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="fullstack">The course teaches HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Wagtail CMS, PHP and MySQL. A complete course in Web Development from a very reputable teacher.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="tensorflow">The course taught the various functionalities of Tensorflow as well as the various architectures involved in making Deep Learning models. The resources were heavy on theory, but there was plenty of practical elements as well.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="harvard-data-science">The Data Science course by Harvard was an essential one, as it taught the entire Data Science process from beginning to end. It was based in the R language, covering its various roles in Visualisation, Wrangling and especially Machine Learning. It is listed as one of the top Data Science courses online.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="python-for-everybody">This was the first programming course I attended, and I was immensely focused on it, finishing the entire course within a week. The course not only went through the Python journey, but it also went into detail the SQL and Github functionalities.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="smo">I've won quite a number of awards in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO), and made it to the second round several times, despite not receiving much training beforehand. As I didn't have any mentors for competitive mathematics, I couldn't develop enough skill to attain the Gold Award in the second round. Due to the high amount of rigor needed to prove the statements, I could not pass through.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="ti">I've attained Gold for the 2018 competition and attained Silver for the 2017 one. In the Texas Instruments competition, a theme is given and the participants are to design a graph to meet that particular theme. Under the "Towards a Smart Nation" theme, I managed to come up with a Gold-worthy design, earning me the feature on the school's Facebook and Instagram pages. My design, which encapsulated the major areas of science, consisted of no fewer than 200 equations and were carefully designed using my custom formulas.</span>
			<span style="display: none;" id="best-in-maths">I was well-known for my Maths during my primary school years, attaining the highest overall grade in 4 out of 5 examinable years. Four times, I've scored at least a 99 in my final year exam. Even the year I didn't receive first, I managed to score a 99. This trend unfortunately didn't continute into secondary school, for I started to face medical issues and missed out on certain exams.</span>
